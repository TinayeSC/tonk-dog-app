# University Society Manager (SocSoc)
## Proof of Concept - Dog Society

- #### **Project Overview**
This project sought to make use of tonk in designing a central hub for student societies and groups. As a committee member of the UoB Dog Society, I have noticed the difficulty in informing 
our whole community of events and trying to manage all the discussions, questions, or voting for new committee members across the uni website, instagram, email, etc. This tonk project aimed at addressing this 
by centralising all of these features across three different- apps 'pixel-dog', 'dawg-gram', 'agm'. "agm" is the most practical of the three and would certainly be considered for adoption by the society after a few 
improvements. 'agm' informs members of events (which can only be added by the owner of the app), allows users to run for open committee roles and vote for candidates and has a message board where
community members can have disucssions. 'dawg-gram' aims to be an instagram but only for photos taken at dog society events. 'pixel-dog' is supposed to be a play area for community members. 
All of these apps are planned to be connected through a login page, where only users with valid university of bristol emails will be able to login (possible use portia ai to authenticate this).
